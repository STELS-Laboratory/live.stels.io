## Welcome, Developer! 👋

We're thrilled to have you here. **STELS Web OS** is more than just a
platform—it's a revolutionary approach to building the decentralized web. If
you're passionate about autonomous systems, distributed computing, and pushing
the boundaries of what's possible with modern web technologies, you're in the
right place.

This documentation will guide you through every aspect of STELS, from your first
steps to building sophisticated autonomous agents that operate across a global
network.

## What is STELS?

**STELS (Structured Technology for Evolving Living Systems)** is the world's
first **distributed Web Operating System** built on heterogeneous networks.
Think of it as an operating system that doesn't run on a single computer—it runs
across hundreds of servers worldwide, creating a unified execution environment
for autonomous web agents.

### The Vision

In the Web 5 era, applications don't just live on servers—they live everywhere.
STELS embraces this vision by providing developers with a professional
laboratory for programming and managing autonomous AI web agents that operate
collectively across a global heterogeneous network.

### What Makes STELS Special?

- **🌍 Truly Distributed**: Your agents run across hundreds of heterogeneous
  nodes (heterogens) installed on diverse servers worldwide
- **🤖 Autonomous by Design**: Build intelligent agents that make decisions and
  execute actions independently
- **🔒 Secure by Default**: Cryptographic identity and transaction signing for
  every operation
- **⚡ Real-Time Everything**: High-speed reactive UI with minimal latency for
  monitoring and control
- **🎨 Visual Programming**: Drag-and-drop canvas for composing complex agent
  workflows
- **💻 Code When You Want**: Monaco-based editor for writing sophisticated
  algorithmic strategies

## Core Capabilities

### 1. **Schemas & Workers**

Create intelligent web agents with structured data flows and programmable
execution logic. Schemas define how data flows through your system, while
Workers execute your custom logic.

### 2. **Distributed Execution**

Your code doesn't run in one place—it runs everywhere. Protocol-driven
operations execute collectively across the heterogeneous network, providing
unprecedented resilience and scalability.

### 3. **Reactive Visualization**

Watch your agents work in real-time. STELS provides high-speed visualizations of
data flows, network activity, and agent operations with minimal latency.

### 4. **Network as API**

The entire heterogeneous network becomes a single unified execution environment.
No need to worry about individual servers—treat the entire network as one
powerful API.

## Getting Started

Ready to dive in? Here's your learning path:

### 📚 Core Documentation

1. **[Reactive UI Engine](UI_ENGINE.md)** - Learn how to build real-time
   interfaces with declarative JSON schemas
2. **[Web 5 Standards](WEB5_STANDARDS.md)** - Understanding decentralized
   identity and data ownership
3. **Schema Manager** - Visual editor for creating UI schemas (in-app)
4. **Worker Editor** - Code editor for algorithmic strategies (in-app)

## Web 5 Standards

STELS is built with **Web 5** principles at its core:

### 🔐 Decentralized Identity

Every user has a cryptographic identity (Gliesereum wallet) that they fully
control. No central authority can revoke or modify your identity.

### 📦 Verifiable Credentials

All operations are signed with your private key, creating verifiable proof of
authenticity without relying on third parties.

### 🌐 Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN)

Heterogens act as personal data stores and execution environments, giving users
full control over their data and computations.

### 🔗 Interoperability

STELS uses open protocols (WebSocket, HTTP/2) and standard formats (JSON,
MessagePack) ensuring interoperability with other Web 5 systems.
