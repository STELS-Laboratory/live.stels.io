## Overview

STELS is a **fully decentralized programming and management system** for
building autonomous web agents that operate across a global heterogeneous
network. Each web agent is a programmable application—a pure web service
leveraging modern browser technologies and distributed execution across hundreds
of heterogeneous nodes (heterogens) installed on diverse servers worldwide.

As a **Web Operating System**, STELS provides developers with:

- **Schemas and Workers**: Tools for creating intelligent web agents with
  structured data flows and programmable execution logic
- **Distributed Execution**: Protocol-driven operations that run collectively
  across the heterogeneous network
- **Reactive Visualization**: High-speed UI with minimal latency for real-time
  monitoring and control
- **Secure by Design**: Cryptographic identity and transaction signing for all
  operations
- **Network as API**: The entire heterogeneous network as a single unified
  execution environment
